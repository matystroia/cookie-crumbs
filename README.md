# CookieCrumbs
Firefox only allows you to manage cookie permissions on a website-wide basis.
This extension achieves tighter matching using Container Tabs.

I got tired of YouTube's recommended videos. Instead of blocking cookies for the whole website, I only wanted to do that on video pages.
I achieve this by adding a new rule on the extension's Options page that points "www.youtube.com/watch*" tabs to a container.
